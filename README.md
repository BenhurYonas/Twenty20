# Twenty20

The game Twenty20 was created as the final lab project for EE 319k Fall 2020 at The University of Texas at Austin. The game is created by Benhur Yonas and Diondre Dubose.
The last lab combines all the previous labs into one 80s-style hand-held game. For more information on EE319K, see http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/. 

This game runs on the EKTM4C123XL Launchpad from Texas Instruments, and requires 2 buttons, a slide potentiometer, some resistors, and the Sitronix ST7735 LCD Display.

Twenty20 won First Place in the EE 319K game competition in the Fall 2020 Semester. Some game footage can be found here: https://youtube.com/watch?v=e6JbRrNk9fs.
